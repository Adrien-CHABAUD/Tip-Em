## General Info

This app allows users to calculate quickly adding a tip to a bill and even dividing the total amount between people. At the end the user can share a summary of the display by text message or insert it into a reminder.

I started by making a low-fidelity prototype of the application and then passed to Figma to make the final high-fidelity prototype to know where to head.
I then made the initial UI with mock data before implementing the functionalities one by one, ending by the share feature using the `ShareLink()` function.

## Technologies

This project uses:
* *Xcode: 14.0.1*
* *Swift: 5.7*
